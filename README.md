# learning-generality

Code for the paper 'Why Deep Learning Generalizes' which may be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09639).  

Gradient splitting is fairly straightforward to implement as gradients are additive.  For implementation of equation (1) in the paper linked, see `cifar10_generalization.py` and for equations (4) and (5) see `objective_generalization.py`.
